# TIC-TAC-TOE

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic paper-and-pencil game typically played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking spaces in the grid with their respective symbols, usually "X" for one player and "O" for the other, until one player achieves a line of three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The objective of the game is to be the first player to create a line of three of their symbols and prevent the opponent from doing so. If the grid is filled without any player achieving a winning line, the game ends in a draw. Tic-tac-toe is simple, easy to learn, and often played as a recreational game by children and adults alike.
